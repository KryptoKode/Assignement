        <p> Hi, <br/>
        <p> I'm a student in electrical engineering. I have already programmed in C, C++, Python. Yesterday, I  learned 
            how to program in HTLM5, CSS and JavaScript in order to submit the code sources you asked for. As hobby, I like 
            video games, political debates and sometimes reading. My qualities are perseverance, debugging skills and
            thirst for knowledge. At my past Co-Op internship , I learned how to use databases on Microsoft SQL and I also 
            work on a source codes of C#. <br/>
        <p> Sincerely, Rahim.</p>
